## 1. Initial Landing Page Experience

When a user first visits the Rea Travel website, they land on the homepage (`app/page.tsx`):

- **Header**: Contains the Rea Travel logo, main navigation menu, and user authentication controls
- **Hero Section**: Features a prominent image with a heading and the flight search form
- **Flight Search Form**: Allows users to input their travel details:

- Origin and destination airports
- Departure and return dates
- Number of passengers
- Trip type (round-trip, one-way, or multi-city)



- **Popular Destinations**: Showcases featured destinations with attractive images and starting prices
- **Special Offers**: Highlights current promotions and deals


At this point, users don't need to be authenticated - they can browse flights without logging in.

## 2. Flight Search Results

After submitting the search form, users are directed to the flight search results page (`app/flights/page.tsx`):

- **Search Summary**: Displays the search criteria (origin, destination, dates, passengers)
- **Filters Sidebar**: Allows refining results by:

- Number of stops
- Price range
- Departure/arrival times
- Airlines



- **Sort Options**: Lets users sort by price, duration, departure time, etc.
- **Flight Cards**: Each card shows:

- Airline information
- Departure and arrival times
- Flight duration and stops
- Price
- "Select" button to proceed with booking





The system fetches flight data through the `/api/flights/search` endpoint, which communicates with the flight API service defined in `lib/flight-api.ts`.

## 3. Flight Details

When a user clicks "Select" on a flight, they're taken to the flight details page (`app/flights/[id]/page.tsx`):

- **Flight Information**: Detailed information about the selected flight:

- Complete departure and arrival details
- Aircraft information
- Baggage allowance
- In-flight amenities



- **Price Summary**: Breakdown of the fare, taxes, and total price
- **Booking Form**: Initial form to collect basic information before proceeding
- **"Continue to Booking" Button**: Takes users to the full booking form


At this point, the system checks if the user is authenticated. If not, they'll be prompted to sign in or register when they try to proceed to booking.

## 4. Authentication (if needed)

If the user isn't signed in, they're redirected to the authentication pages:

- **Sign In Page** (`app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`): For existing users
- **Sign Up Page** (`app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`): For new users


These pages use Clerk for authentication, providing:

- Email/password login
- Social login options
- Account creation
- Password recovery


After successful authentication, users are redirected back to continue their booking process.

## 5. Booking Process

Once authenticated, users proceed to the booking page (`app/flights/[id]/booking/page.tsx`), which contains a multi-step form:

### Step 1: Passenger Details

- Collects information for each passenger:

- Name
- Date of birth
- Travel document details (passport/ID)
- Nationality



- Contact information for booking notifications


### Step 2: Seat Selection

- Interactive seat map for both outbound and return flights
- Different seat categories with varying prices
- Visual indication of available and unavailable seats


### Step 3: Optional Extras

- Baggage options:

- Additional checked bags
- Special equipment (sports gear, musical instruments)



- Meal preferences:

- Standard, vegetarian, vegan, etc.
- Premium meal upgrades



- Additional services:

- Travel insurance
- Priority boarding
- Airport lounge access





### Step 4: Review

- Complete summary of the booking:

- Flight details
- Passenger information
- Selected seats
- Chosen extras
- Price breakdown



- Terms and conditions acceptance
- "Continue to Payment" button


During this process, the system creates a booking record in the database through the `/api/bookings` endpoint, with status set to "pending".

## 6. Payment Process

After reviewing the booking, users proceed to the payment page (`app/flights/[id]/payment/page.tsx`):

- **Order Summary**: Recap of the booking details and total price
- **Payment Form**: Secure payment processing options:

- Credit/debit card (via Stripe integration)
- PayPal
- Apple Pay



- **Security Information**: Reassurance about payment security


The payment process works as follows:

1. The system creates a payment intent through Stripe via the `/api/payments` endpoint
2. User enters payment details, which are sent directly to Stripe (never touching the server)
3. Stripe processes the payment and returns a result
4. The system updates the booking status based on the payment result


## 7. Booking Confirmation

Upon successful payment, users see the confirmation page with:

- **Success Message**: Confirmation that the booking is complete
- **Booking Reference**: Unique identifier for the booking
- **Complete Itinerary**: All flight and passenger details
- **Action Buttons**:

- Download itinerary
- Email confirmation
- Print details
- Share booking





The system also sends an email confirmation to the user's email address.

## 8. Post-Booking Management

After booking, users can:

- **View Bookings**: See all their bookings in their account
- **Manage Bookings**: Make changes to existing bookings
- **Cancel Bookings**: Cancel if needed (subject to airline policies)


## 9. Admin Functions

For administrators, the system provides:

- **Dashboard** (`app/admin/page.tsx`): Overview of bookings, revenue, and system status
- **Bookings Management** (`app/admin/bookings/page.tsx`): View and manage all bookings
- **Settings** (`app/admin/settings/page.tsx`): Configure system parameters


## Technical Flow Behind the Scenes

1. **Data Flow**:

1. Client-side components make requests to API routes
2. API routes interact with the database via Prisma
3. External services (flight data, payments) are accessed through dedicated libraries



2. **Authentication Flow**:

1. Clerk handles user authentication
2. Auth state is maintained across the application
3. Protected routes check authentication status



3. **Database Interactions**:

1. Bookings table stores all booking information
2. Payments table tracks payment attempts and statuses
3. Relationships between tables maintain data integrity



4. **Error Handling**:

1. Client-side validation prevents invalid submissions
2. Server-side validation ensures data integrity
3. Error boundaries catch and display user-friendly error messages





This comprehensive flow creates a seamless experience from search to booking confirmation, with appropriate authentication and security measures throughout the process.
